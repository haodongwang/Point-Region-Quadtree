Point Region Quadtree


The Course

Point Region Quadtree is a data structure produced by Jens Åkerblom during a data structure project course at the University of Helsinki Computer Science in Spring 2011 (Joint Project Group: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lubbers/teaching/groups/jpg/2010-4/). The course was about 1½ month (initial meeting at 18.03, project deadline at 04.05), and at the time I also completed the Programming Project.


Implementation

The data structure is written in C++ and does not use STL containers to store the data. For more info on the implementation, read the documentation and source.

The files released on GitHub have not been changed since the project deadline, so the coding standard and design is not representative to my current programming level but shows my abilities to build and finish projects.

Make files are not included for the testing application.


Post Mortem

Alot has changed since this project, and as such if I would remake this project, some things would've been implemented differently.

More specifically, I would've used templates and tried to mimic the STL architecture with allocator objects and typedefs.
